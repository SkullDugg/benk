            <p>
                ~> To solve the double coincidence of wants, people came up with the idea to use gold as a common form of currency.It meant that anyone could buy anything without searching the right person to buy from.
                Gold was often used in the form of coins and bars.

            <p>
                ~> Due to the limited availability and high cost of gold, coins made out of iron, nickel, etc. were introduced. Though golden coins were still prevelent but were considered as a higher form of currency having a higher value than the other coins. Kings often were found to make their citizen use custom coins inscribed with some marking of them in their territory.

                ~> Since all the coins were made out of metals and there were no decent alternatives, cheaper metals also started becoming more and more precious day-by-day. They also were very heavy and hard to carry around. Fake coins also were easy to make.

            <p>
                ~> To solve the issue of common theft and to keep a check on people's balances, banks became more prevelant and people started to deposit most of their money in a savings account in return of which they get a debit card usually encripted with a 4-digit PIN. People can easily use this card to withdraw money through ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) and pay with a simple hand-held card machine. Credit cards are also available which are basically a form of 'buy now pay later' form of exchange.
