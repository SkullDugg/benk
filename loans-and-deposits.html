            <h1>What is a loan?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> A loan is an arrangement under which a lender allows another party the use of funds in exchange of an interest payment along with the return of the principal amount at the end.

            <h1>How can I get a loan?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> To obtain a loan from a bank one must have the proper documents and some form of collateral. Then, the person can approach the banks and ask for the required money and depending on a few other terms like tenure, the rate of interest and the mode of repayment, the bank will lend the loan to the borrower.

            <h1>What is collateral?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> Collateral is an asset which is a property of a borrower of loan such as â€“ land, building, livestock, deposits with bank etc. The borrower uses this 'asset' as a guarantee to the lender (the one who gives money) until the loan is repaid by the borrower.
            </p>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <h1>What if I don't have any collateral?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> Our bank provides special schemes for the people who don't have any collateral to pay to the bank. <br> For example, If a farmer needs an agricultural loan and doesn't have much collateral to return the payment, he /she can make an agreement with the bank to just pay the principal amount back with some interest only. <br> The same can be arrangened for other poor workers with some form of promise to pay back also.

            <h1>What are deposits with banks?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> Most of the people need only some currency for their daily needs. Rest of the amount is usually kept as deposit in banks. Money which is kept in a bank is safe and it even earns an interest. One can withdraw money from his account as and when required. Since deposit in the bank account can be withdrawn on demand, these deposits are called demand deposits.

            <h1>Why should one deposit his / her money in the banks?</h1>
            <p>
                ~> One should deposit money in a bank to create savings and earn interest on it. A demand deposit is made for funds you can withdraw anytime. A time deposit is a long-term investment. A deposit could also be the collateral amount you pay when you take on a loan.
